There are also essential details such as hotel, whether the customer canceled, lead time, market segment, distribution channel, customer type, ADR (average daily rate), days in the waiting list, previous cancellations, and whether they are repeated guests.\n",

    "## Conclusion & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended strategies to reduce booking cancellations➖\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that long lead and wait times likely play a role in reason for cancellations, I recommend that the following measures be employed:- \n",
    "\n",
    "- The IT and Systems Team should **streamline** the online booking process like infusing real-time availability and automated confirmation to minimize waiting times for guests. \n",
    "- Communications Team should regularly engage with guests through personalized welcome messages, strategic newsletters or updates about special offers and events, to keep guests motivated about their upcoming stay and well informed about hotel amenities, services and experience, as well as local attractions.\n",
    "- Optimize the Travel-Agencies/Tour-Operators channels, through the provision of targeted incentives, deals as well as clear cancellation policies. A feedback system or Surveys should be introduced to better understand the reasons behind cancellations.\n",
    "- Encourage guests to book by offering exclusive deals, promotions and packages during the Summer and Spring seasons.\n",
    "- Dynamic pricing strategies that adjust rates based on the demand and other factors should be explored, as offering competitive pricing during peak cancellation periods may attract more bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Strategies to increase length of stay\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve observed some factors that may be responsible for length of stay, based on this, I recommend the following:- \n",
    "\n",
    "- Capitalizing on stays peak period-summer and December for City Hotel and Summer, Fall and Spring for Resort hotel, offer seasonal packages and promotions to attract guests during these peak periods. Focus marketing efforts on attracting guests from Senegal, Azerbaijan, Togo, North Macedonia, and Armenia for Resort hotel and Faroe Islands, Senegal, Angola, Cape Verde, and Guinea-Bissau for City Hotel, given that they tend to stay the longest; through tailored marketing campaigns, partnerships, or promotions targeting these specific nationalities to increase their engagement.\n",
    "- Tailor marketing strategies for the top market segments—Offline TA/TO, Online TA, and Group segments for Resort Hotel, and Aviation and Online TA segments for City Hotel, introduce extended stay packages and benefits, loyalty programs or exclusive perks for guests in these segments to encourage longer bookings.\n",
    "- Since guests booking through TA/TO channels for Resort Hotel and Direct and TA/TO for City hotel tend to stay longer, we should focus on increasing visibility, special deals, discounts and promotions through these channels. We should provide incentives for bookings through these channels. And as for channels with lower stays, like Corporate & GDS distribution, explore strategies to incentivize longer stays.\n",
    "- Engage with Contract & Transient customers by offering personalized services or exclusive amenities for their longer stays. For Group customers, consider creating packages that encourage them to extend their stays with group-friendly activities and benefits, emphasizing the City & Resort Hotel's amenities and attractions for a longer and more enjoyable stay.\n",
    "- Promote Triple (D) and Single (E) rooms for both Hotels, as ideal choices for guests seeking longer stays, emphasizing their comfort and features. Also consider special rates or packages for these room type. Rooms with shorter stays, Superior Room (B) and Deluxe Room (L) for the Resort Hotel as well as the Presidential Suite (P) for the City Hotel should be paired with exclusive experiences or perks.\n",
    "- Collect feedback from guests who both stayed for shorter or longer durations and use it to identify areas for improvement. Address concerns and make enhancements to the guest experience, amenities, or services to sustain and encourage longer stays.\n",
    "- Collaborate with local businesses or attractions to create attractive packages that encourage longer stays. Offer bundled services, such as spa treatments, guided tours, or dining experiences, to entice guests to extend their visit.\n",
    "- Use data analytics to personalize marketing and promotional efforts. Create targeted offers based on guests' booking history, preferences, and behaviors. Send personalized promotions to past guests who stayed for shorter durations to entice them for longer stays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Strategies to increase Repeat bookings➖\n",
    "\n",
    "Having uncovered repeat bookings pattern, I recommend the following:— \n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement targeted loyalty programs to encourage repeat bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Launch initiatives targeting the **Transient** customers, the Direct, Corporate and online TA/TO market segments, which comprises a significant portion of both old and new guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leverage insights on booking channels such as **TA/TO and Corporate** to optimize marketing strategies for both old and new guests.\n",
    "- Further explore opportunities to attract guests from other regions, complementing the existing strong representation from Portugal and the United Kingdom.\n",
    "- Focus on providing an exceptional guest experience to build loyalty. Satisfied guests are less likely to cancel reservations. Ensure that services, amenities, and facilities meet or exceed guest expectations."
